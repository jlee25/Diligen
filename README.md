This project was built with React.

## Diligen Test Challenge

- Authentication was done with Firebase with Email Address and Password.
- NPM modules used was Highlighting, React-Router.
- Sass was used for styling instead of styled components


## Challenges

- I never did email and password authentication before. I have always used google auth and 0Auth so it was great to try something new.
- I spent most of the time trying to figure out a way to highlight using the mouse instead of an input. I will be spending more time to see if I can figure it out.

## Feedback

- I would love to hear feedback on what could be done better. I am always ready to learn and become a better programmer.
